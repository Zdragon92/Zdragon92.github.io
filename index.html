					<h1>Zaccheus Everett CS-499</h1>
					<p>Throughout SNHU’s computer science program the coursework has challenged me to both learn how to work independently, 
                    as well as learn how to collaborate in team environments. In the software development lifecycle course (CS-250), 
                    I worked alongside other students to learn and demonstrate roles within the agile development cycle. 
                    This included ways of effectively communicating with both coworkers and stakeholders, 
                    which included deciphering customer concerns into technical solutions and translating technical terms and processes for non-technical customers. 
                    Courses such as Introduction to structured database environments (DAD-220) and client/server development (CS-340) 
                    taught me how to work with SQL and MongoDB databases respectively. 
                    While the software security (CS-305) course taught me how to develop and test more secure code.<br />
						The artifacts below are the grazioso rescue animal artifact and an SQL database artifact. 
                        The grazioso artifact is a java project that had the most influence on the final artifact. 
                        The grazioso artifact itself is an application that allows users to find and reserve rescue animals. 
                        It displays skill use of data structures and engineering skills. 
                        For the SQL database artifact straightforwardly displays database manipulation skills. 
                        Finally, the party manager application is the enhanced artifact that takes the grazioso, 
                        changes the programming language, adds a database, and other features to fit a tabletop game resource rather than a rescue animal application. </p>

							<h3>Software engineering Milestone</h3>
							<p>The Artifact included is the grazioso rescue animal java application. It was created in class IT-145. The artifact showcases several software development techniques including object-oriented programming. The artifact was improved by refactoring the application in Python, integrating a database, modifying the content, then adding extra features. In the process of enhancing the artifact I learned quite a bit including when to take advantage of Python’s loosely typed language and when to enforce more strongly set restrictions.</p>

							<h3>Data structures Milestone</h3>
							<p>The artifact added is the Grazioso rescue animal application created in course IT-145 in 2023. It is a java application that allows users to select and reserve rescue animals through a menu within the application. I selected this enhancement because it made use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage and modularize the data within the application to achieve an elegant solution. The enhancement improves the artifact by using Python dictionaries and classes to further modularize the program. With these enhancements, the enhanced artifact is able to communicate with the MongoDB database and still remain elegant and modular. While enhancing and modifying the artifact, I had to constantly adapt to the strengths of the Python language, which had me going over functions and classes multiple times to ensure they made use of their unique abilities.</p>

							<h3>Database Milestone</h3>
							<p>The database artifact is a collection of searches in MySQL created in the DAD-220 class. The artifact was included to showcase a depth of skill in utilizing SQL databases. In the artifact, queries are combined to display more information than what was directly stored in the database. For enhancing this artifact, I moved to include a NoSQL database (MongoDB) in order to showcase skill in another database language.</p>
